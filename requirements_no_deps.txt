# This file is for packages that we want to install using the --no-deps flag
# In particular, one of the dependencies of nvidia-modulus (nvidia_dali_cuda110)
# cannot be installed on MacOS. Since we'd like to be able to do dev on Macs, and
# since we do not currently require the features in modulus that depend on
# nvidia_dali_cuda110, we choose to install nvidia-modulus with --no-deps
